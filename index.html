<h3>April 24th 2013</h3>

<div class="description">
	<p>This past week I spent the majority of my time enhancing the
		telemetry
		visualization. Unfortunately, I have succumbed to optimistic
		estimation and this is taking longer than expected.
	</p>

	<p>I have spent a couple of days reading through the datazilla code
		responsible for doing the statistical analysis. Aside a few
		questions for
		<a href="https://phonebook.mozilla.org/tree.php#search/jeads@mozilla.com">Jeads</a>,
		I believe I understand what the code is doing. I still have not
		found a
		test case or data to run it through the debugger, but I have
		come
		to the conclusion that the one-test-at-a-time procedure it uses
		can be improved:
	</p>

	<p>I suggest the overall procedure will look like this:
	<ol>
		<li>Grab all the test results for some time (revision) range
		</li>
		<li>Use existing statistical libraries to annotate the test
			results.
		</li>
		<li>Compare annotations to previous annotations calculated for
			that data range.
		</li>
		<li>Update database where there are differences, making sure the
			<span class="code">modified_date</span> is updated.
		</li>
	</ol>
	This set-wise procedure has the immediate benefit of providing time
	series
	in the form the statistical libraries need it. Furthermore, being
	able to process, and
	reprocess the series will allow us to compensate for previously
	missing data that can alter our
	conclusions. Finally, as test results arrive, the egregious
	regressions
	can be marked immediately, while the more subtle regressions (that
	require
	more samples to improve confidence) can be marked later.

			I hope to start uncovering instances where Mozilla goes right or
			wrong so that we can learn how best to respect

			These charts are noisy, they do not properly follow cohorts, and
