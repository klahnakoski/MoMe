	<h4>About Project</h4>
	The bugzilla data is in Metric's ElasticSearch container, and is updated every 10 minutes.  My goal is to provide metrics and numbers to development teams tha can not be easily pulled from Bugzilla directly.

		<p>This past week-and-a-half I have been familiarizing myself with
			Metric's Telemetry setup, learning Python for ReleaseManagement's
			new dashboards, and trying to push something out for the Metro project.</p>
		<p>The biggest barrier to Metro is the limitation of my charting library,
			<a href="http://www.webdetails.pt/ctools.html#tabccc">CCC (Community Chart Components)</a>.  They have released version 2, and I was still stuck on version 1.
		The new version has about 100 javascript files, and would be a pain to include all my pages (did I mention I have no server,
			and all my pages are static?).  I would consider using the minimized version in a single file, but these libraries are still new, and require some
			debugging to work properly on the edge cases I will inevitably encounter.
		</p>
			<p>The solution is to use something like require.js to manage the packaging of this
			large library finally abstract away all the problems </p>
